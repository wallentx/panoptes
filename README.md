# Panoptes

Panoptes builds a local structural map of a source repository for people and
coding agents. It indexes definitions, imports, and resolvable calls into one
SQLite database outside the repository, then exposes that graph through a CLI
and MCP. Named for Argus Panoptes, it provides a broad view of a codebase while
keeping source and queries on the local machine.

It is a native Rust executable. There is no Node.js runtime, npm, `npx`, daemon,
telemetry, model API, or repository-local agent configuration.

## What it does

- Indexes TypeScript, TSX, JavaScript, Python, Go, and Rust.
- Finds relevant symbols for natural-language questions.
- Groups regex or literal matches under their enclosing symbol.
- Traverses incoming and outgoing call/import relationships.
- Produces file skeletons, repository maps, JSON, Markdown, and an HTML viewer.
- Serves the same tools to Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Antigravity,
  OpenCode, and GitHub Copilot CLI through MCP.
- Incrementally reparses changed files and automatically refreshes normal CLI
  queries when source changes.

Panoptes does not modify an indexed repository. Its shared database defaults to
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/panoptes/panoptes.db`, falling back to
`~/.local/share/panoptes/panoptes.db`.

## Install

Install the native CLI from the explicit
[`wallentx/panoptes`](https://github.com/wallentx/panoptes) repository and
`main` branch.

Install Git, Rust, Cargo, and a C compiler with the operating system package
manager. On Termux, the required packages are available with:

```sh
pkg update
pkg install git rust clang
```

Clone the repository so it can be inspected, then run the local installer:

```sh
git clone --branch main --single-branch https://github.com/wallentx/panoptes.git
cd panoptes
./install.sh
```

This builds for the host Rust target and installs the executable to
`~/.local/bin/panoptes`. On Termux that produces a native Android/Bionic binary;
no `proot` environment is required.

If `~/.local/bin` is not already on `PATH`, add it to your shell configuration:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Choose another user-owned installation root when needed:

```sh
./install.sh --prefix "$HOME/.local/panoptes"
```

The installer never uses `sudo`. It builds only the checkout containing the
script, verifies that the installed binary starts, and then prints the exact
`PATH` entry and next steps.

### Direct Cargo install

If inspecting a clone first is not required:

```sh
cargo install \
  --git https://github.com/wallentx/panoptes.git \
  --branch main \
  --locked \
  --root "$HOME/.local" \
  panoptes
```

The `main` branch is mutable. For a reproducible source install, replace
`--branch main` with `--rev <full-commit-sha>`.

### Update or uninstall

The `upgrade` command explains the update policy but never downloads or executes
anything. Update an inspect-first installation from its checkout:

```sh
cd panoptes
git pull --ff-only origin main
./install.sh
```

For a complete uninstall, first run the provider picker and uncheck every
registered provider. This removes only Panoptes's MCP entries and preserves all
other provider settings:

```sh
panoptes init
```

Optionally remove every indexed graph and reclaim the database space. Source
repositories are never touched:

```sh
panoptes cache clear --yes
```

Then remove an installation made under the default root:

```sh
cargo uninstall --root "$HOME/.local" panoptes
```

## Configure providers

Run `init` with no options to open the interactive checkbox picker:

```sh
panoptes init
```

```text
Select providers (space toggles, enter confirms)
> [ ] Claude Code           ~/.claude.json
  [x] Codex                 ~/.codex/config.toml             registered
  [ ] Cursor                ~/.cursor/mcp.json
```

Only providers containing an actual Panoptes registration start checked. Installed
providers without one are labelled `detected` but remain unchecked. Move with
the arrow keys, toggle with space, and apply the selection with enter. Checking
a provider registers or refreshes Panoptes; unchecking a registered provider
deregisters it. Existing unrelated entries are preserved, invalid JSON is
refused, and writes are private and atomic.

For scripts or headless machines, repeat `--provider` instead of opening the
picker:

```sh
panoptes init --provider codex --provider claude
panoptes init --provider claude --deregister
panoptes init --provider cursor --dry-run
panoptes init --provider opencode --dry-run --json
```

Supported provider IDs and destinations:

| Provider ID | Provider | User configuration |
|---|---|---|
| `claude` | Claude Code | `~/.claude.json` |
| `codex` | Codex | `~/.codex/config.toml` |
| `cursor` | Cursor | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` |
| `gemini` | Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/settings.json` |
| `antigravity` | Antigravity | `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` |
| `opencode` | OpenCode | `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` |
| `copilot` | GitHub Copilot CLI | `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` |

The registered command is the installed executable's absolute path. No
machine-specific path, hook, prompt, or provider file is written into a source
repository.

## Quick start

```sh
cd /path/to/repository
panoptes build
panoptes map
panoptes ask "where is request validation handled?" --source
panoptes callers validate_request --depth 2
panoptes grep 'TODO|FIXME' --path .
panoptes check
```

`build` walks the Git worktree using gitignore-compatible rules and skips
TypeScript declaration files. Subsequent builds reuse unchanged extraction
payloads. Large cold builds use at most four parser workers; use `--jobs 1` or
`PANOPTES_JOBS=1` on a memory-constrained device.

After provider registration, MCP automatically indexes the repository when the
provider connects and incrementally refreshes changed source before later answers.
The MCP `freshness` tool is observational and does not trigger a build.
This makes Panoptes available in any repository opened by a registered provider;
running `panoptes build` first is optional unless you want to pre-warm the index.

Normal CLI query commands refresh an existing stale index before answering;
their initial index is still created explicitly with `panoptes build`. CLI `check`
and `status` are observational. Use global `--no-refresh` or
`PANOPTES_NO_REFRESH=1` to disable MCP startup indexing and all automatic refreshes
when an intentional stored snapshot is required.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `build [path]` | Incrementally index a repository or multi-repository workspace |
| `ask <query> [path]` | Ranked lexical and structural symbol retrieval |
| `grep <pattern> --path <path>` | Regex or literal source search grouped by symbol |
| `callers <symbol>` | Traverse incoming or outgoing calls and imports |
| `skeleton <file>` | List definitions, signatures, and spans in one file |
| `map [path]` | Show directory clusters, hubs, and hotspots |
| `viz [path]` | Serve a loopback viewer or write self-contained HTML |
| `export <destination>` | Write deterministic Markdown cards or JSON |
| `init` | Select and configure MCP providers |
| `mcp [path]` | Serve newline-delimited MCP JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout |
| `check [path]` | Fail when an index is missing, stale, or incompatible |
| `status [path]` | Report graph counts, age, schema, extractor, and source drift |
| `cache clear --yes` | Remove all indexed graphs and reclaim database space |
| `cache prune` | Remove records for repository paths that no longer exist |
| `cache doctor` | Run SQLite's full integrity check |
| `cache recover` | Preserve a damaged store and create a clean replacement |
| `cache reset [path]` | Remove one repository graph from the shared store |
| `version` | Show binary, build, schema, extractor, and store identity |
| `upgrade` | Show the safe update path without modifying the executable |
| `completions <shell>` | Generate shell completion code |

Run `panoptes <command> --help` for the complete flags. Read commands provide JSON
where applicable. `ask`, `grep`, and `callers` accept segment-aware `--in`
scopes.

Exit status `0` means the command completed, including an empty search. Status
`1` means a failed freshness/integrity check or another runtime error. Status `2`
means bad input, an unindexed repository, or a missing/ambiguous requested node.

## MCP tools

The MCP server exposes:

- `find`
- `grep`
- `callers`
- `skeleton`
- `map`
- `status`
- `freshness`

Requests and responses are capped at 1 MiB. Retrieval is local and
deterministic; Panoptes does not send source code or queries to a model service.

## Multi-repository workspaces

A non-repository directory containing at least two immediate Git repository
children is treated as a workspace. Build and query commands federate those
children and label results by repository. Ranked results are interleaved so one
large child cannot consume the entire result limit.

Linked Git worktrees keep separate graph rows because their checked-out source
can differ. Their shared Git directory is recorded only for diagnostics.

## Viewer and exports

`panoptes viz` starts a self-contained HTML viewer on loopback. Binding a non-loopback
address requires explicit `--allow-remote`:

```sh
panoptes viz
panoptes viz --output map.html
```

Exports are deterministic and require an explicit destination. Existing output
is not replaced without `--force`:

```sh
panoptes export docs/panoptes-map
panoptes export graph.json --json
```

## Graph boundaries

Panoptes records `contains`, `imports`, and calls it can resolve without guessing.
Unknown receiver types stay unresolved instead of creating false same-name
edges. Inheritance and arbitrary reference edges are not part of the native
`callers` contract.

Natural-language `ask` is deterministic local retrieval over symbol names,
signatures, bounded definition bodies, graph coupling, and test-path de-ranking.
There is no embedding service or `--deep` model enrichment.

## Security and privacy

- Indexed source and queries stay on the machine.
- The index lives outside the repository.
- Provider setup touches only explicitly selected user configuration files.
- Invalid existing JSON is never overwritten.
- There is no self-updater or remote installer execution.
- Release archives contain a stripped binary, README, license, and SHA-256
  sidecar; verify the checksum before copying a release binary onto `PATH`.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for reporting and policy details.

## Development

```sh
git clone --branch main https://github.com/wallentx/panoptes.git
cd panoptes
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo test --workspace --all-targets --locked
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo build --workspace --release --locked
```

The deterministic performance harness records wall time, peak RSS, database
size, device/toolchain metadata, SQLite plans, and optional syscall profiles:

```sh
./scripts/benchmark.sh --output /tmp/panoptes-benchmark
```

The output directory contains raw measurements, a median summary, environment
metadata, and SQLite query plans. The performance workflow uploads that directory
as a per-run artifact. Results are device- and fixture-specific, so the repository
does not treat measurements from one machine as canonical performance data.
